Ever try using npm link with React? While it works for simple examples, more often it will break
when one starts adding hooks into their application. While things like Storybook are great for developing components in
isolation, sometimes it makes sense to locally test components in the application that is consuming them. Lets explore why
npm (and yarn) link is broken, and how we can use yalc to fix it

### Why?

My favorite way of building component libraries is in a monorepo using yarn
workspaces. I recently converted
[craco-babel-loader](https://github.com/rjerue/craco-babel-loader) to use such a
style here. What's nice is that since everything is using a package.json as it
would in the wild, there's little "magic" that needs to be done outside of just
using workspaces. Unfortunately, not all projects, especially enterprise ones
can fall neatly into this bucket. So, conventional wisdom says one should
probably use [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-link) or
[yarn link](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link/) to develop a package
separate from where it would be used.

Note, throughout this, one should be able to substitute the use of npm link for
yarn link. You can use either link command in either package manager and will
run into just about the same nuances.

### Loving npm link

Let's try it!

I've created the
[following repo as an example](https://github.com/rjerue/link-usage-example). It
contains a standard CRA application in the `cra-app` folder with `my-component`
as the stand-in for our component library.

Start by cloning it down, and doing a `cd my-component` followed by a
`yarn install`, `yarn build`, and finally: `npm link`. This will create a global
link for what is listed as the `name` field in the `package.json` file. You
should get a message saying that the package was added.

Now, go into the `cra-app` and do a `yarn install` followed by
`npm link my-component`. This will add a symlink for `my-component` in the
node_modules folder of `cra-app`. Run `npm start` in the `cra-app` and the app
should render! There should be text that reads "Hello World" in the browser!

Mission accomplished! Time to go home right!? Let's try just throwing a hook
into `MyComponent` now and do a `yarn build` in `my-component`!

```jsx
import React from "react";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log("npm link is my best friend!");
  }, []);
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
};
```

...and kaboom! Like any epic tragedy, at the end of the first act so falls the
non-titular yet somehow the expected hero of the story.

### Hating npm link

You are probably here for two reasons. Either you're researching tooling for
building component libraries, or you've been burned by this guy after running
`npm link`:

```text
Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a
function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:

1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React
   DOM)
2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app See
   https://reactjs.org/link/invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and
   fix this problem.
```

That's no fun! Let's take a close look at what the error means:

1. My package.json has the versions of React and React DOM being the same, so
   likely not this.
2. Pretty sure I'm not breaking the rules of hooks.
3. Is there more than one version of React?

That's our only remaining option, right? There's a pretty useful command called
`npm ls` that will tell us what is hanging out in our node modules folder.

```bash
$ npm ls react

cra-app@0.1.0 /Users/rjerue/dev/yalc-examples/cra-app
â”œâ”€â”¬ @testing-library/react@11.2.7
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ react@17.0.2 deduped
â”œâ”€â”¬ component-lib@1.0.0 extraneous -> ./../component-lib
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ react@17.0.2 extraneous
â”œâ”€â”¬ react-dom@17.0.2
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ react@17.0.2 deduped
â”œâ”€â”¬ react-scripts@4.0.3
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ react@17.0.2 deduped
â””â”€â”€ react@17.0.2
```

Uh oh! There is indeed two versions of react living inside of our application!
There's one inside of our cra app, and there is another in the component
library. But why? I have peer dependencies set up correctly and at the very
least, they're the same version so it should be deduplicated, right? RIGHT?

Well, if this was treated like a _real_ dependency, yes. However, technically
`my-component` isn't even in our package.json, it was added via npm link. Even
if it was in there though, adding it via npm link creates a symlink inside of
node_modules to the root of `my-component`. The `my-component` directory has its
own `node_modules` folder and inside of it... its own version of react.

All `npm link` does is just create a symlink, it doesn't rebuild the module tree
to dedupe the version of react.

A fun sanity check is to just delete `my-component/node_modules/react` and the
error will go away. Heck, why even include it as a devDependency? Well in the
real world, one likely has tests living alongside their components, and that
will indeed need some version of react to run those tests against. React is also
just the tip of the iceberg. One could also run into problems with things that
require a single instance of a library, such as things that create new react
contexts that both applications would consume the same instance of.

### Falling in love with yalc

It is my opinion that `npm link` is broken. All it serves as is a fancy wrapper
around `ln`. Npm's module resolution algorithm does not care that it is a
symlink. It'll treat the folder like any other application and look for
dependencies in its package before moving a folder upwards. The first instance
of react found by the code in `my-component/dist/index.js` is in
`my-component/node_modules/react` rather than the node_modules of cra-app. One
solution is to create more symlinks, but this does not really solve other issues
and can lead to big pain. Luckily there's a better way.

The library [yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) by "wclr" (a.k.a. "whitecolor"
or "alex") was made to solve this problem. In its own words, it _acts as a very
simple local repository for your locally developed packages that you want to
share across your local environment_ and was made specifically to prevent the
problems created by using `npm link` and `yarn link`.

In our example, let's install [yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) globally with
`npm i yalc -g`. One may also instead install it as a dev dependency where
needed and use `npx` if one would prefer to avoid global packages. Go into
`my-component` and run `yalc publish`. One will get something like:

```bash
$ yalc publish
component-lib@1.0.0 published in store.
```

Now go back to `cra-app` and run `yalc add component-lib`. One should see an
output similar to:

```bash
$ yalc add component-lib
Package component-lib@1.0.0 added ==> /Users/rjerue/dev/yalc-examples/cra-app/node_modules/component-lib
```

From there, running `npm start` in `cra-app` will yield a working component with
the message that we logged to the console earlier.

### Using yalc Effectively

[Yalc has some pretty comprehensive documentation](https://github.com/wclr/yalc#usage)
on how it can be used. Though, here's the cliff notes:

- `yalc publish` ðŸ‘‰ Writes files that would be in npm registry to a local
  registry
- `yalc add` ðŸ‘‰ Adds the yalc dependency to your project over what is in the
  package.json. Adds a `.yalc` folder with contents and a signature lock file.
- `yalc link` ðŸ‘‰ Similar to `npm link` but only links the files that would be in
  the remote npm. Does not persist between `yarn install` runs.

One can add the `yalc.lock` lock file and `.yalc` folder to gitignore. It's not
very useful in git.

My favorite part of [yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) is that the `publish`
command also supports the propagation of updates to where the package has been
added or linked. Try changing the component in `component-lib` while CRA is
running and run the following command and notice the accompanying output in the
terminal:

```bash
$ yarn build && yalc publish --push
yarn run v1.22.17
$ microbundle --jsx React.createElement
Build "component-lib" to dist:
        226 B: index.cjs.gz
        171 B: index.cjs.br
        173 B: index.modern.js.gz
        134 B: index.modern.js.br
        181 B: index.module.js.gz
        135 B: index.module.js.br
        311 B: index.umd.js.gz
        245 B: index.umd.js.br
âœ¨  Done in 1.03s.
component-lib@1.0.0 published in store.
Pushing component-lib@1.0.0 in /Users/rjerue/dev/yalc-examples/cra-app
Package component-lib@1.0.0 added ==> /Users/rjerue/dev/yalc-examples/cra-app/node_modules/component-lib
```

You _should_ see those changes be hot reloaded into the running `cra-app`!

#### Watching For Great DevX

There are also ways that you can add a watch setup for these commands! As the
component library is using microbundle to create a single output folder, we can
use a tool like nodemon and npm-run-all to automatically publish changes after a
build is done!

Start by installing the following packages:

```bash
$ yarn add npm-run-all yalc nodemon --dev
```

and then add the following under `scripts` in the `package.json` of the
component library:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // ... other scripts
    "dev": "microbundle watch --jsx React.createElement",
    "watch-dist": "nodemon --delay 1 --watch dist --exec \"yalc publish --push\"",
    "start": "run-p dev watch-dist"
  }
}
```

What this does is it runs the microbundle watcher and nodemon in parallel.
Nodemon will watch the `dist` folder and do a publish after it is updated by a
new build running.

If using another tool to build the library, just replace `dev` with whatever
script you use, and replace `dist` with the outputted library with the built
files.

### Wrapping Up!

The commands `npm link` and `yarn link` are the cause of the `Invalid hook call`
error message because it leads to there being more than one copy of React in the
same app. [Yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) gets around this by creating
something similar to a local npm registry and allows for you to treat your local
library like any other as opposed to the link commands that treat them
differently. This allows for one to develop component libraries locally in the
application that is consuming it with all the traditional comforts of dev tools
such as hot reloading!

What sorts of cool things are you going to be building using yalc? ðŸ˜Ž

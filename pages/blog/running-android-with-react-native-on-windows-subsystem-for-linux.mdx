### Why?

I use a Mac at work and a PC for most of my personal work. There's positives and
negatives about each, however by far PCs are more accessible. Meaning, folks are
far more likely to be own and/or be able to afford a PC. Globally, this is also
the case with android devices. Macs do enable one to develop and test iPhone
apps, while PCs do not. Meaning to create an iPhone app, one will need a Mac.
One does not need a fancy Mac computer to start coding apps! Learn and do great
things with what you have!

### Setting Up WSL

First, one needs to set up Windows Subsystem for Linux, aka WSL. To do this, one
should follow
[Microsoft's own instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
A tl;dr summary is the following:

- Make sure windows 10 version 2004, build 19041 or higher are running. To check
  this, press `Windows Key + r` on the keyboard, type in `winver` and select ok.
  The version and build number will be displayed.
- Check if virtualization support is enabled by clicking start, typing in "task
  manager," navigate to performance, click CPU and on the bottom there should be
  something that says "Virtualization: Enabled." If this is **not** the case,
  follow
  [these linked instructions](https://2nwiki.2n.cz/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75202968#:~:text=ON%20the%20System.-,Press%20F2%20key%20at%20startup%20BIOS%20Setup.,changes%20and%20Reboot%20into%20Windows.)
  to enable virtualization for one's machine based on it's manufacturer.
- Open powershell as administrator (right click, run as administrator) and type
  `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart`
  to enable Virtual Machine Platform in windows.
- While still inb powershell as administrator type
  `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart`
- Reboot the machine.
- Open powershell as administrator and type `wsl --set-default-version 2`.
- If there's a message stating a kernel update is needed, follow
  [these linked instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-kernel).
- [Go to the windows store and download Ubuntu with this link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6).

Once installed, connect to it by opening a shell
([I suggest getting/using Window Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk70))
and just typing in `ubuntu`. There will be some prompts to set up an account.

### Setting up Node and NPM

The following sequence of commands will install node and npm

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install nodejs
$ node -v
$ sudo apt install npm
$ npm -v
```

This is all that is needed to start doing traditional web development in a WSL
environment.

### Setting Up Android in Windows

The "host" windows installation is going to be what runs the emulated android
device as well as an instance of adp (android debugger).
[Download and install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

To make a virtual device, do the following after creating a new project and
following the prompts:

1. Then hit the AVD manager button. Phone with the Android alien head peeking.

   ![AVD manager button](/static/avd-manager.png)

2. Click "Create Virtual Device"
3. Select a device. I suggest a pixel 2. Hit next
4. Hit download next to the release name "Q." Follow prompts to download. Once
   highlighted, hit next.
5. Hit finish.

Now one needs to set up adb:

1. On the android studio page, download the "SDK tools package" for windows.
2. Once downloaded, extract the zip to `C:\platform-tools`
3. Bring up the menu to edit system environment variables, see below:

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img width="90%" src="/static/environment-start-menu.png" />
</div>

4. Hit "Environmental Variables"
5. Under "System Variables" select `PATH` and hit "edit"
6. Hit new and add `C:\platform-tools` to the list.
7. Hit Ok, Ok, and a final, Ok. to close all of the dialog windows.

The `adb` command now should be able to be run from new terminal instance in the
host windows env.

## Setting Up On Linux

Making a react native app is pretty standard. Run the following from the user
home directory. To get there type `cd ~`. To create a new react native project
run `npx react-native init ProjectName` optionally substituting ProjectName with
a different name.

Next, run the following sequence of commands. One should just copy them and run.

```bash
cd ~
sudo apt-get install unzip
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/sdk-tools-linux-4333796.zip
unzip sdk-tools-linux-4333796.zip -d Android
rm sdk-tools-linux-4333796.zip
sudo apt-get install -y lib32z1 openjdk-8-jdk
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
printf "\n\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64\nexport PATH=\$PATH:\$JAVA_HOME/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
cd Android/tools/bin
./sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-26" "build-tools;26.0.3"
export ANDROID_HOME=/home/$USER/Android
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
printf "\n\n\nexport ANDROID_HOME=/home/$USER/Android\nexport PATH=\$PATH:\$ANDROID_HOME/tools\nexport PATH=\$PATH:\$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools" >> ~/.bashrc
android update sdk --no-ui
printf "\n\nexport export WSL_HOST=$(tail -1 /etc/resolv.conf | cut -d' ' -f2)\nexport export ADB_SERVER_SOCKET=tcp:\$WSL_HOST:5037" >> ~/.bashrc
sudo apt-get install gradle
gradle -v
```

The output of the final command should be the version of gradle being used.

### Bringing It All Together

The app now has everything needed to run.

In Windows,

1.  Go to Android Studio's AVD manager and press the green play button.
2.  In a terminal run as administrator:

    1. `adb kill-server`
    2. `adb -a nodaemon server start`
    3. One should see something similar to the following in the output of
       `adb devices`

       ```powershell
       PS C:\Users\Ryan> adb devices
         List of devices attached
         emulator-5554 device
       ```

In the ProjectName directory:

1. In one terminal window, run the following:
   `npx react-native start --host 127.0.0.1`
2. In a second terminal: run the following:
   `npx react-native run-android --variant=debug --deviceId emulator-5554` where
   `emulator-5554` matches the output of the device command.

One may save those in their package json as the following:

```json
    {
      ...
      "scripts": {
        "wsl-server": "npx react-native start --host 127.0.0.1",
        "wsl-android": "npx react-native run-android --variant=debug --deviceId emulator-5554",
        ...
      }
      ...
    }
```

React native should be running on the android device in windows!

### Troubleshooting

1. Restart the computer
2. Restart the emulator with a cold boot. To do this close the emulator and go
   to restart it, but instead of clicking the play button, hit the down caret to
   the right and run a cold boot.
3. Make sure USB debugging is enabled on android. To do this go to settings in
   the emulator, hit the build number until it says developer options are
   enabled, then go to developer options and enable usb debugging.
4. Check the path variables. Anything that says `export` in linux is a
   variables. Run `echo $variable` to see it's result. For example
   `echo $WSL_HOST` outputs `172.28.48.1`.

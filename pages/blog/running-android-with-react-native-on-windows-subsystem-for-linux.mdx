## React Native Android on Windows Subsystem for Linux

<p>{intro}</p>

### Setting Up WSL

First, one needs to set up Windows Subsystem for Linux, aka WSL. To do this, one
should follow
[Microsoft's own instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
A tl;dr summary is the following:

- Make sure you are running windows 10 version 2004, build 19041 or higher. To
  check this, press `Windows Key + r` on your keyboard, type in `winver` and
  select ok. The version and build number will be displayed.
- Check if virtualization support is enabled by clicking start, typing in "task
  manager," navigate to performance, click CPU and on the bottom there should be
  something that says "Virtualization: Enabled." If this is **not** the case,
  follow
  [these linked instructions](https://2nwiki.2n.cz/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75202968#:~:text=ON%20the%20System.-,Press%20F2%20key%20at%20startup%20BIOS%20Setup.,changes%20and%20Reboot%20into%20Windows.)
  to enable virtualization for your machine based on it's manufacturer.
- Open powershell as administrator (right click, run as administrator) and type
  `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart`
  to enable Virtual Machine Platform in windows.
- While still inb powershell as administrator type
  `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart`
- Reboot your machine.
- Open powershell as administrator and type `wsl --set-default-version 2`.
- If there's a message stating a kernel update is needed, follow
  [these linked instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-kernel).
- [Go to the windows store and download Ubuntu with this link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6).

Once installed, connect to it by opening a shell
([I suggest getting/using Window Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk70))
and just typing in `ubuntu`. There will be some prompts to set up an account.

### Setting up Node and NPM

The following sequence of commands will install node and npm

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install nodejs
$ node -v
$ sudo apt install npm
$ npm -v
```

This is all you need to start doing traditional web development in a WSL
environment.

### Android on the host

The "host" windows installation is going to be what runs the emulated android
device as well as an instance of adp (android debugger).
[Download and install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

To make a virtual device, do the following after creating a new project and
following the prompts:

1. Then hit the AVD manager button. Phone with the Android alien head peeking.

   ![AVD manager button](/static/avd-manager.png)

2. Click "Create Virtual Device"
3. Select a device. I suggest a pixel 2. Hit next
4. Hit download next to the release name "Q." Follow prompts to download. Once
   highlighted, hit next.
5. Hit finish.

To start a virtual device, hit the AVD manager button and click the green play
next to the device.

Now one needs to set up adb:

1. On the android studio page, download the "SDK tools package" for windows.
2. Once downloaded, extract the zip to `C:\platform-tools`
3. Bring up the menu to edit system environment variables, see below:

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img width="90%" src="/static/environment-start-menu.png" />
</div>

4. Hit "Environmental Variables"
5. Under "System Variables" select `PATH` and hit "edit"
6. Hit new and add `C:\platform-tools` to the list.
7. Hit Ok, Ok, and you guessed it, Ok. to close all of the dialog windows.

The `adb` command now should be able to be run from new terminal instance in the
host windows env.

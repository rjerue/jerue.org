One does not need a top of the line machine or a mac in order to start learning how to develop things with React Native. While tools such as
expo allow for one to test on any smartphone, that is not even necessary. Learn how to set up a developer environment for React Native on a

## Setting Up WSL

First, one needs to set up Windows Subsystem for Linux, aka WSL. To do this, one
should follow
[Microsoft's own instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
A tl;dr summary is the following:

- Make sure you are running windows 10 version 2004, build 19041 or higher. To
  check this, press `Windows Key + r` on your keyboard, type in `winver` and
  select ok. The version and build number will be displayed.
- Check if virtualization support is enabled by clicking start, typing in "task
  manager," navigate to performance, click CPU and on the bottom there should be
  something that says "Virtualization: Enabled." If this is **not** the case,
  follow
  [these linked instructions](https://2nwiki.2n.cz/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75202968#:~:text=ON%20the%20System.-,Press%20F2%20key%20at%20startup%20BIOS%20Setup.,changes%20and%20Reboot%20into%20Windows.)
  to enable virtualization for your machine based on it's manufacturer.
- Open powershell as administrator (right click, run as administrator) and type
  `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart`
  to enable Virtual Machine Platform in windows.
- While still inb powershell as administrator type
  `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart`
- Reboot your machine.
- Open powershell as administrator and type `wsl --set-default-version 2`.
- If there's a message stating a kernel update is needed, follow
  [these linked instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-kernel).
- [Go to the windows store and download Ubuntu with this link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6).
